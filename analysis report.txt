Hi, (student name). Thanks for using our portal 'Online Adaptive Assesement Portal'  This is your analysis report for (subject-name).

Your percentile score was 74.3 %. Which is considered to be very good. Your average time  to answer each question is 2:35 minutes.You can still perform better. You have attempted 12 easy level question out of which 9 were correct. 15 medium level question out of which 8 were correct. And 3 hard level question out of which 1 is correct. Hence your (subject-accuracy) is 45%. 

(if user have given mock test second time  )
Comparing your current mock test score with previous one, we came to conclusion that. You have improved by 3%. Which is considered to be very bad.  You need to work hard to improve you accuracy in (subject).

 You can still perform better. Best of luck for the next Mock Test.
